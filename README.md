# pixijs-elm
Partial pixijs wrapper for elm
This is a partial wrapper for Pixi ParticleContainers in Elm, using the ParticleContainer demo from the Pixi web site as a basis.  

Unfortunately Elm adds too much overhead to manage 10000 particles, with a 6700K it is closer to 500 particles

The examples require elm-reactor
